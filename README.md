This program is a rudimentary password checker that takes an input from the user as text input in the terminal and then returns a rating of the password based on it's strength. It is meant to serve as a basic example of strength-checkers that websites often use to try and improve the base level of security in user passwords. This program does not check for the similarity of characters in the password, only if they are present. It also checks the password against a text file of the 1000 most commonly used passwords.

This program requires Python3 and can be run from the terminal with `python3 main.py`

This program is not secure and stores the input in plain text without encryption. You should not rely on it for security or safety and see it more of an educational tool or concept. The ratings are relative and should not be taken as a truth.
